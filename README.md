# Hive-HDFS
**Learning Hive and HDFS**
- SQL-Like Queries (HiveQL): Hive uses HiveQL, a query language similar to SQL, making it easier for data analysts and stakeholders to query and analyze the data without requiring deep knowledge of Hadoop-specific tools.
- Integration with Hadoop: Hive integrates seamlessly with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), allowing for the efficient storage and analysis of large datasets across multiple nodes. This integration ensures optimal performance when working with high volumes of data.
